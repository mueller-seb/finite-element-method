%FEM FOR TWO DIFFERENT BOUNDARY VALUE PROBLEMS

%Left boundary value problem, called BVP 1
%   -laplace(u) = sin(pi*x)*sin(pi*y) in Omega
%     u = 0 on boundary of Omega (Dirichlet condition)
%     Omega = [0,1]^2

%Right boundary value problem, calles BVP 2
%    -laplace(u)+u = cos(pi*x)*cos(pi*x) in Omega
%     partial_n(u) = 0 on boundary of Omega (Neumann condition)
%     Omega = [0,1]^2
%Further mathematical description of the problem in Remark 3.27 (Neumann boundary conditions)
