# finite-element-method
Finite element code in matlab for two different boundary value problems:

BVP1
    -laplace(u) = sin(pi*x)*sin(pi*y) in Omega
    u = 0 on boundary of Omega
    Omega = [0,1]^2

BVP2
    -laplace(u)+u = cos(pi*x)*cos(pi*x) in Omega
    partial_n(u) = 0 on boundary of Omega
    Omega = [0,1]^2

#HowTo
Run main_[domain]_[BVP]
